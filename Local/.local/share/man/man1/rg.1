.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
ripgrep (rg) recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern\&. By default, ripgrep will respect your \&.gitignore and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files\&.
.sp
ripgrep\(cqs default regex engine uses finite automata and guarantees linear time searching\&. Because of this, features like backreferences and arbitrary look\-around are not supported\&. However, if ripgrep is built with PCRE2, then the \fB\-\-pcre2\fR flag can be used to enable backreferences and look\-around\&.
.sp
ripgrep supports configuration files\&. Set \fBRIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH\fR to a configuration file\&. The file can specify one shell argument per line\&. Lines starting with \fB#\fR are ignored\&. For more details, see the man page or the \fBREADME\fR\&.
.sp
ripgrep will automatically detect if stdin exists and search stdin for a regex pattern, e\&.g\&. \fBls | rg foo\fR\&. In some environments, stdin may exist when it shouldn\(cqt\&. To turn off stdin detection explicitly specify the directory to search, e\&.g\&. \fBrg foo \&./\fR\&.
.sp
Tip: to disable all smart filtering and make ripgrep behave a bit more like classical grep, use \fBrg \-uuu\fR\&.
.SH "REGEX SYNTAX"
.sp
ripgrep uses Rust\(cqs regex engine by default, which documents its syntax: https://docs\&.rs/regex/*/regex/#syntax
.sp
ripgrep uses byte\-oriented regexes, which has some additional documentation: https://docs\&.rs/regex/*/regex/bytes/index\&.html#syntax
.sp
To a first approximation, ripgrep uses Perl\-like regexes without look\-around or backreferences\&. This makes them very similar to the "extended" (ERE) regular expressions supported by \fBegrep\fR, but with a few additional features like Unicode character classes\&.
.sp
If you\(cqre using ripgrep with the \fB\-\-pcre2\fR flag, then please consult https://www\&.pcre\&.org or the PCRE2 man pages for documentation on the supported syntax\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fIPATTERN\fR
.RS 4
A regular expression used for searching\&. To match a pattern beginning with a dash, use the \-e/\-\-regexp option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
A file or directory to search\&. Directories are searched recursively\&. File paths specified explicitly on the command line override glob and ignore rules\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Note that many options can be disabled via flags\&. In some cases, those flags are not listed in a first class way below\&. For example, the \fB\-\-column\fR flag (listed below) enables column numbers in ripgrep\(cqs output, but the \fB\-\-no\-column\fR flag (not listed below) disables them\&. The reverse can also exist\&. For example, the \fB\-\-no\-ignore\fR flag (listed below) disables ripgrep\(cqs \fBgitignore\fR logic, but the \fB\-\-ignore\fR flag (not listed below) enables it\&. These flags are useful for overriding a ripgrep configuration file on the command line\&. Each flag\(cqs documentation notes whether an inverted flag exists\&. In all cases, the flag specified last takes precedence\&.
.PP
\fB\-A, \-\-after\-context\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS 4
Show NUM lines after each match\&.
.sp
This overrides the \-\-context and \-\-passthru flags\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-auto\-hybrid\-regex\fR
.RS 4
DEPRECATED\&. Use \-\-engine instead\&.
.sp
When this flag is used, ripgrep will dynamically choose between supported regex engines depending on the features used in a pattern\&. When ripgrep chooses a regex engine, it applies that choice for every regex provided to ripgrep (e\&.g\&., via multiple \-e/\-\-regexp or \-f/\-\-file flags)\&.
.sp
As an example of how this flag might behave, ripgrep will attempt to use its default finite automata based regex engine whenever the pattern can be successfully compiled with that regex engine\&. If PCRE2 is enabled and if the pattern given could not be compiled with the default regex engine, then PCRE2 will be automatically used for searching\&. If PCRE2 isn\(cqt available, then this flag has no effect because there is only one regex engine to choose from\&.
.sp
In the future, ripgrep may adjust its heuristics for how it decides which regex engine to use\&. In general, the heuristics will be limited to a static analysis of the patterns, and not to any specific runtime behavior observed while searching files\&.
.sp
The primary downside of using this flag is that it may not always be obvious which regex engine ripgrep uses, and thus, the match semantics or performance profile of ripgrep may subtly and unexpectedly change\&. However, in many cases, all regex engines will agree on what constitutes a match and it can be nice to transparently support more advanced regex features like look\-around and backreferences without explicitly needing to enable them\&.
.sp
This flag can be disabled with \-\-no\-auto\-hybrid\-regex\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-B, \-\-before\-context\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS 4
Show NUM lines before each match\&.
.sp
This overrides the \-\-context and \-\-passthru flags\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-binary\fR
.RS 4
Enabling this flag will cause ripgrep to search binary files\&. By default, ripgrep attempts to automatically skip binary files in order to improve the relevance of results and make the search faster\&.
.sp
Binary files are heuristically detected based on whether they contain a NUL byte or not\&. By default (without this flag set), once a NUL byte is seen, ripgrep will stop searching the file\&. Usually, NUL bytes occur in the beginning of most binary files\&. If a NUL byte occurs after a match, then ripgrep will still stop searching the rest of the file, but a warning will be printed\&.
.sp
In contrast, when this flag is provided, ripgrep will continue searching a file even if a NUL byte is found\&. In particular, if a NUL byte is found then ripgrep will continue searching until either a match is found or the end of the file is reached, whichever comes sooner\&. If a match is found, then ripgrep will stop and print a warning saying that the search stopped prematurely\&.
.sp
If you want ripgrep to search a file without any special NUL byte handling at all (and potentially print binary data to stdout), then you should use the
\fI\-a/\-\-text\fR
flag\&.
.sp
The
\fI\-\-binary\fR
flag is a flag for controlling ripgrep\(cqs automatic filtering mechanism\&. As such, it does not need to be used when searching a file explicitly or when searching stdin\&. That is, it is only applicable when recursively searching a directory\&.
.sp
Note that when the
\fI\-u/\-\-unrestricted\fR
flag is provided for a third time, then this flag is automatically enabled\&.
.sp
This flag can be disabled with
\fI\-\-no\-binary\fR\&. It overrides the
\fI\-a/\-\-text\fR
flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-block\-buffered\fR
.RS 4
When enabled, ripgrep will use block buffering\&. That is, whenever a matching line is found, it will be written to an in\-memory buffer and will not be written to stdout until the buffer reaches a certain size\&. This is the default when ripgrep\(cqs stdout is redirected to a pipeline or a file\&. When ripgrep\(cqs stdout is connected to a terminal, line buffering will be used\&. Forcing block buffering can be useful when dumping a large amount of contents to a terminal\&.
.sp
Forceful block buffering can be disabled with \-\-no\-block\-buffered\&. Note that using \-\-no\-block\-buffered causes ripgrep to revert to its default behavior of automatically detecting the buffering strategy\&. To force line buffering, use the \-\-line\-buffered flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b, \-\-byte\-offset\fR
.RS 4
Print the 0\-based byte offset within the input file before each line of output\&. If \-o (\-\-only\-matching) is specified, print the offset of the matching part itself\&.
.sp
If ripgrep does transcoding, then the byte offset is in terms of the the result of transcoding and not the original data\&. This applies similarly to another transformation on the source, such as decompression or a \-\-pre filter\&. Note that when the PCRE2 regex engine is used, then UTF\-8 transcoding is done by default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s, \-\-case\-sensitive\fR
.RS 4
Search case sensitively\&.
.sp
This overrides the \-i/\-\-ignore\-case and \-S/\-\-smart\-case flags\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-color\fR \fIWHEN\fR
.RS 4
This flag controls when to use colors\&. The default setting is
\fIauto\fR, which means ripgrep will try to guess when to use colors\&. For example, if ripgrep is printing to a terminal, then it will use colors, but if it is redirected to a file or a pipe, then it will suppress color output\&. ripgrep will suppress color output in some other circumstances as well\&. For example, if the TERM environment variable is not set or set to
\fIdumb\fR, then ripgrep will not use colors\&.
.sp
The possible values for this flag are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
never    Colors will never be used\&.
auto     The default\&. ripgrep tries to be smart\&.
always   Colors will always be used regardless of where output is sent\&.
ansi     Like \*(Aqalways\*(Aq, but emits ANSI escapes (even in a Windows console)\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
When the \-\-vimgrep flag is given to ripgrep, then the default value for the \-\-color flag changes to
\fInever\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-colors\fR \fICOLOR_SPEC\fR \&...
.RS 4
This flag specifies color settings for use in the output\&. This flag may be provided multiple times\&. Settings are applied iteratively\&. Colors are limited to one of eight choices: red, blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black\&. Styles are limited to nobold, bold, nointense, intense, nounderline or underline\&.
.sp
The format of the flag is
\fI{type}:{attribute}:{value}\fR\&.
\fI{type}\fR
should be one of path, line, column or match\&.
\fI{attribute}\fR
can be fg, bg or style\&.
\fI{value}\fR
is either a color (for fg and bg) or a text style\&. A special format,
\fI{type}:none\fR, will clear all color settings for
\fI{type}\fR\&.
.sp
For example, the following command will change the match color to magenta and the background color for line numbers to yellow:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
rg \-\-colors \*(Aqmatch:fg:magenta\*(Aq \-\-colors \*(Aqline:bg:yellow\*(Aq foo\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Extended colors can be used for
\fI{value}\fR
when the terminal supports ANSI color sequences\&. These are specified as either
\fIx\fR
(256\-color) or
\fIx,x,x\fR
(24\-bit truecolor) where x is a number between 0 and 255 inclusive\&. x may be given as a normal decimal number or a hexadecimal number, which is prefixed by
0x\&.
.sp
For example, the following command will change the match background color to that represented by the rgb value (0,128,255):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
rg \-\-colors \*(Aqmatch:bg:0,128,255\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
or, equivalently,
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
rg \-\-colors \*(Aqmatch:bg:0x0,0x80,0xFF\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that the the intense and nointense style flags will have no effect when used alongside these extended color codes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-column\fR
.RS 4
Show column numbers (1\-based)\&. This only shows the column numbers for the first match on each line\&. This does not try to account for Unicode\&. One byte is equal to one column\&. This implies \-\-line\-number\&.
.sp
This flag can be disabled with \-\-no\-column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C, \-\-context\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS 4
Show NUM lines before and after each match\&. This is equivalent to providing both the \-B/\-\-before\-context and \-A/\-\-after\-context flags with the same value\&.
.sp
This overrides both the \-B/\-\-before\-context and \-A/\-\-after\-context flags, in addition to the \-\-passthru flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-context\-separator\fR \fISEPARATOR\fR
.RS 4
The string used to separate non\-contiguous context lines in the output\&. This is only used when one of the context flags is used (\-A, \-B or \-C)\&. Escape sequences like \ex7F or \et may be used\&. The default value is \-\-\&.
.sp
When the context separator is set to an empty string, then a line break is still inserted\&. To completely disable context separators, use the \-\-no\-context\-separator flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c, \-\-count\fR
.RS 4
This flag suppresses normal output and shows the number of lines that match the given patterns for each file searched\&. Each file containing a match has its path and count printed on each line\&. Note that this reports the number of lines that match and not the total number of matches, unless \-U/\-\-multiline is enabled\&. In multiline mode, \-\-count is equivalent to \-\-count\-matches\&.
.sp
If only one file is given to ripgrep, then only the count is printed if there is a match\&. The \-\-with\-filename flag can be used to force printing the file path in this case\&. If you need a count to be printed regardless of whether there is a match, then use \-\-include\-zero\&.
.sp
This overrides the \-\-count\-matches flag\&. Note that when \-\-count is combined with \-\-only\-matching, then ripgrep behaves as if \-\-count\-matches was given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-count\-matches\fR
.RS 4
This flag suppresses normal output and shows the number of individual matches of the given patterns for each file searched\&. Each file containing matches has its path and match count printed on each line\&. Note that this reports the total number of individual matches and not the number of lines that match\&.
.sp
If only one file is given to ripgrep, then only the count is printed if there is a match\&. The \-\-with\-filename flag can be used to force printing the file path in this case\&.
.sp
This overrides the \-\-count flag\&. Note that when \-\-count is combined with \-\-only\-matching, then ripgrep behaves as if \-\-count\-matches was given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-crlf\fR
.RS 4
When enabled, ripgrep will treat CRLF (\fI\er\en\fR) as a line terminator instead of just
\fI\en\fR\&.
.sp
Principally, this permits
\fI$\fR
in regex patterns to match just before CRLF instead of just before LF\&. The underlying regex engine may not support this natively, so ripgrep will translate all instances of
\fI$\fR
to
\fI(?:\er??$)\fR\&. This may produce slightly different than desired match offsets\&. It is intended as a work\-around until the regex engine supports this natively\&.
.sp
CRLF support can be disabled with \-\-no\-crlf\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Show debug messages\&. Please use this when filing a bug report\&.
.sp
The \-\-debug flag is generally useful for figuring out why ripgrep skipped searching a particular file\&. The debug messages should mention all files skipped and why they were skipped\&.
.sp
To get even more debug output, use the \-\-trace flag, which implies \-\-debug along with additional trace data\&. With \-\-trace, the output could be quite large and is generally more useful for development\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-dfa\-size\-limit\fR \fINUM+SUFFIX?\fR
.RS 4
The upper size limit of the regex DFA\&. The default limit is 10M\&. This should only be changed on very large regex inputs where the (slower) fallback regex engine may otherwise be used if the limit is reached\&.
.sp
The argument accepts the same size suffixes as allowed in with the \-\-max\-filesize flag\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-E, \-\-encoding\fR \fIENCODING\fR
.RS 4
Specify the text encoding that ripgrep will use on all files searched\&. The default value is
\fIauto\fR, which will cause ripgrep to do a best effort automatic detection of encoding on a per\-file basis\&. Automatic detection in this case only applies to files that begin with a UTF\-8 or UTF\-16 byte\-order mark (BOM)\&. No other automatic detection is performed\&. One can also specify
\fInone\fR
which will then completely disable BOM sniffing and always result in searching the raw bytes, including a BOM if it\(cqs present, regardless of its encoding\&.
.sp
Other supported values can be found in the list of labels here:
https://encoding\&.spec\&.whatwg\&.org/#concept\-encoding\-get
.sp
For more details on encoding and how ripgrep deals with it, see GUIDE\&.md\&.
.sp
This flag can be disabled with \-\-no\-encoding\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-engine\fR \fIENGINE\fR
.RS 4
Specify which regular expression engine to use\&. When you choose a regex engine, it applies that choice for every regex provided to ripgrep (e\&.g\&., via multiple \-e/\-\-regexp or \-f/\-\-file flags)\&.
.sp
Accepted values are
\fIdefault\fR,
\fIpcre2\fR, or
\fIauto\fR\&.
.sp
The default value is
\fIdefault\fR, which is the fastest and should be good for most use cases\&. The
\fIpcre2\fR
engine is generally useful when you want to use features such as look\-around or backreferences\&.
\fIauto\fR
will dynamically choose between supported regex engines depending on the features used in a pattern on a best effort basis\&.
.sp
Note that the
\fIpcre2\fR
engine is an optional ripgrep feature\&. If PCRE2 wasn\(cqt included in your build of ripgrep, then using this flag will result in ripgrep printing an error message and exiting\&.
.sp
This overrides previous uses of \-\-pcre2 and \-\-auto\-hybrid\-regex flags\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-field\-context\-separator\fR \fISEPARATOR\fR
.RS 4
Set the field context separator, which is used to delimit file paths, line numbers, columns and the context itself, when printing contextual lines\&. The separator may be any number of bytes, including zero\&. Escape sequences like \ex7F or \et may be used\&. The default value is \-\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-field\-match\-separator\fR \fISEPARATOR\fR
.RS 4
Set the field match separator, which is used to delimit file paths, line numbers, columns and the match itself\&. The separator may be any number of bytes, including zero\&. Escape sequences like \ex7F or \et may be used\&. The default value is \-\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f, \-\-file\fR \fIPATTERNFILE\fR \&...
.RS 4
Search for patterns from the given file, with one pattern per line\&. When this flag is used multiple times or in combination with the \-e/\-\-regexp flag, then all patterns provided are searched\&. Empty pattern lines will match all input lines, and the newline is not counted as part of the pattern\&.
.sp
A line is printed if and only if it matches at least one of the patterns\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-files\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-l, \-\-files\-with\-matches\fR

.sp
This overrides \-\-files\-without\-match\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-files\-without\-match\fR
.RS 4

.sp
This overrides \-\-files\-with\-matches\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings\fR
.RS 4
Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression\&. When this flag is used, special regular expression meta characters such as \&.(){}*+ do not need to be escaped\&.
.sp
This flag can be disabled with \-\-no\-fixed\-strings\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-L, \-\-follow\fR
.RS 4
When this flag is enabled, ripgrep will follow symbolic links while traversing directories\&. This is disabled by default\&. Note that ripgrep will check for symbolic link loops and report errors if it finds one\&.
.sp
This flag can be disabled with \-\-no\-follow\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g, \-\-glob\fR \fIGLOB\fR \&...
.RS 4
Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given glob\&. This always overrides any other ignore logic\&. Multiple glob flags may be used\&. Globbing rules match \&.gitignore globs\&. Precede a glob with a ! to exclude it\&. If multiple globs match a file or directory, the glob given later in the command line takes precedence\&.
.sp
As an extension, globs support specifying alternatives:
\fB\-g ab{c,d}\fR
is equivalet to
\fB\-g abc \-g abd\fR\&. Empty alternatives like
\fB\-g ab{,c}\fR
are not currently supported\&. Note that this syntax extension is also currently enabled in gitignore files, even though this syntax isn\(cqt supported by git itself\&. ripgrep may disable this syntax extension in gitignore files, but it will always remain available via the \-g/\-\-glob flag\&.
.sp
When this flag is set, every file and directory is applied to it to test for a match\&. So for example, if you only want to search in a particular directory
\fIfoo\fR, then
\fB\-g foo\fR
is incorrect because
\fIfoo/bar\fR
does not match the glob
\fIfoo\fR\&. Instead, you should use

\fB\-\-heading\fR
.RS 4

.sp
A file or directory is considered hidden if its base name starts with a dot character (\fI\&.\fR)\&. On operating systems which support a

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-json\fR
.RS 4
Enable printing results in a JSON Lines format\&.
.sp
When this flag is provided, ripgrep will emit a sequence of messages, each encoded as a JSON object, where there are five different message types:
.sp
\fBbegin\fR
\- A message that indicates a file is being searched and contains at least one match\&.
.sp
\fBend\fR
\- A message the indicates a file is done being searched\&. This message also include summary statistics about the search for a particular file\&.
.sp
\fBmatch\fR
\- A message that indicates a match was found\&. This includes the text and offsets of the match\&.
.sp
\fBcontext\fR
\- A message that indicates a contextual line was found\&. This includes the text of the line, along with any match information if the search was inverted\&.
.sp
\fBsummary\fR
\- The final message emitted by ripgrep that contains summary statistics about the search across all files\&.
.sp
Since file paths or the contents of files are not guaranteed to be valid UTF\-8 and JSON itself must be representable by a Unicode encoding, ripgrep will emit all data elements as objects with one of two keys:
\fItext\fR
or

\fB\-U, \-\-multiline\fR
.RS 4
Enable matching across multiple lines\&.
.sp
When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match cannot include a line terminator\&. For example, when multiline mode is not enabled (the default), then the regex
\fI\ep{any}\fR
will match any Unicode codepoint other than
\fI\en\fR\&. Similarly, the regex
\fI\en\fR
is explicitly forbidden, and if you try to use it, ripgrep will return an error\&. However, when multiline mode is enabled,
\fI\ep{any}\fR
will match any Unicode codepoint, including
\fI\en\fR, and regexes like
\fI\en\fR
are permitted\&.
.sp
An important caveat is that multiline mode does not change the match semantics of
\fI\&.\fR\&. Namely, in most regex matchers, a
\fI\&.\fR
will by default match any character other than
\fI\en\fR, and this is true in ripgrep as well\&. In order to make
\fI\&.\fR
match
\fI\en\fR, you must enable the "dot all" flag inside the regex\&. For example, both
\fI(?s)\&.\fR
and
\fI(?s:\&.)\fR
have the same semantics, where
\fI\&.\fR
will match any character, including
\fI\en\fR\&. Alternatively, the
\fI\-\-multiline\-dotall\fR
flag may be passed to make the "dot all" behavior the default\&. This flag only applies when multiline search is enabled\&.
.sp
There is no limit on the number of the lines that a single match can span\&.
.sp
\fBWARNING\fR: Because of how the underlying regex engine works, multiline searches may be slower than normal line\-oriented searches, and they may also use more memory\&. In particular, when multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep requires that each file it searches is laid out contiguously in memory (either by reading it onto the heap or by memory\-mapping it)\&. Things that cannot be memory\-mapped (such as stdin) will be consumed until EOF before searching can begin\&. In general, ripgrep will only do these things when necessary\&. Specifically, if the \-\-multiline flag is provided but the regex does not contain patterns that would match
\fI\en\fR
characters, then ripgrep will automatically avoid reading each file into memory before searching it\&. Nevertheless, if you only care about matches spanning at most one line, then it is always better to disable multiline mode\&.
.sp
This flag can be disabled with \-\-no\-multiline\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-multiline\-dotall\fR

This flag enables "dot all" in your regex pattern, which causes

Normally, a
\fI\&.\fR

.sp
This flag is generally intended to be used in an alias or your ripgrep config file if you prefer "dot all" semantics by default\&. Note that regardless of whether this flag is used, "dot all" semantics can still be controlled via inline flags in the regex pattern itself, e\&.g\&.,
\fI(?s:\&.)\fR

In some cases it can be desirable to turn these things off\&. The \-\-no\-unicode flag will do exactly that\&.

For PCRE2 specifically, Unicode mode represents a critical trade off in the user experience of ripgrep\&. In particular, unlike the default regex engine, PCRE2 does not support the ability to search possibly invalid UTF\-8 with Unicode features enabled\&. Instead, PCRE2
\fBrequires\fR
that everything it searches when Unicode mode is enabled is valid UTF\-8\&. (Or valid UTF\-16/UTF\-32, but for the purposes of ripgrep, we only discuss UTF\-8\&.) This means that if you have PCRE2\(cqs Unicode mode enabled and you attempt to search invalid UTF\-8, then the search for that file will halt and print an error\&. For this reason, when PCRE2\(cqs Unicode mode is enabled, ripgrep will automatically "fix" invalid UTF\-8 sequences by replacing them with the Unicode replacement codepoint\&. This penalty does not occur when using the default regex engine\&.
.sp
If you would rather see the encoding errors surfaced by PCRE2 when Unicode mode is enabled, then pass the \-\-no\-encoding flag to disable all transcoding\&.

\-\-type\-add can also be used to include rules from other types with the special include directive\&.

Lines starting with
\fB#\fR
(optionally preceded by any amount of whitespace) are ignored\&.
.RE
.sp
ripgrep will look for a single configuration file if and only if the \fBRIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH\fR environment variable is set and is non\-empty\&. ripgrep will parse shell arguments from this file on startup and will behave as if the arguments in this file were prepended to any explicit arguments given to ripgrep on the command line\&. Note though that the \fIrg\fR command you run must still be valid\&. That is, it must always contain at least one pattern at the command line, even if the configuration file uses the \fI\-e/\-\-regexp\fR flag\&.
.sp
For example, if your ripgreprc file contained a single line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\-\-smart\-case
.fi
.if n \{\

.SH "CAVEATS"
.sp
ripgrep may abort unexpectedly when using default settings if it searches a file that is simultaneously truncated\&. This behavior can be avoided by passing the \fB\-\-no\-mmap\fR flag which will forcefully disable the use of memory maps in all cases\&.
.sp
ripgrep may use a large amount of memory depending on a few factors\&. Firstly, if ripgrep uses parallelism for search (the default), then the entire output for each individual file is buffered into memory in order to prevent interleaving matches in the output\&. To avoid this, you can disable parallelism with the \fB\-j1\fR flag\&. Secondly, ripgrep always needs to have at least a single line in memory in order to execute a search\&. A file with a very long line can thus cause ripgrep to use a lot of memory\&. Generally, this only occurs when searching binary data with the \fB\-a\fR flag enabled\&. (When the \fB\-a\fR flag isn\(cqt enabled, ripgrep will replace all NUL bytes with line terminators, which typically prevents exorbitant memory usage\&.) Thirdly, when ripgrep searches a large file using a memory map, the process will report its resident memory usage as the size of the file\&. However, this does not mean ripgrep actually needed to use that much memory; the operating system will generally handle this for you\&.
